# Pokemmo Breeding simulator

This tool is inspired by the [pokemmohub breeding tool](https://pokemmohub.com/tools/breeding/) that helps you track the amount of pokemon's you need to capture/buy to breed a competitive Pokemon

## Improvments on the pokemmohub's tool

- Improved usability by being able to select which Pokemon species you are aiming to breed
  - By doing that you are able to filter only Pokemons that are capable of breeding with your desired breed.
- Your gender guarantee cost for each breed step is automatically generated based on the species [gender ratio](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_gender_ratio)
- If in any step of the breeding tree, there is any pokemon that can only be female, the breed will not proceed
